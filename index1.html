    <p class="clr22">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the diffrence is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elemente. ID on the other hand, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element .ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript .
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="clr22">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of element on a web page.Once an element has been targeted ,a style or set of style  can be applioed to the element .</p>
    <br>
